## Overview
SRT API is intended to expose details related to a SRT code, its description, timesheet, model, product line, region etc., which enables the DMS providers to have information on the rates, work units at the time of creating a flat rate work order repair/quote. A DMS provider can query the SRT data on a real time basis by providing the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or the Model Number. The API provides information that are available in Smart basket application today for the given equipment or model after filtering information that might not be useful for the dealers. All the SRT and its relevant data are extracted from the Smart Basket system of CNHi.
Pictorial representation of the data flows below.
