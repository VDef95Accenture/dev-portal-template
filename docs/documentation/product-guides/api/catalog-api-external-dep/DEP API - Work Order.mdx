## Overview
Workorder API is structured to capture the information about the critical attributes used in the work order at the time of creation in any DMS systems. As part of the other APIs like eWarranty, Faults, SRT, and Telemetry CNHi will be sharing the basic information required to create the Work Order.  Whereas, this API, along with the vehicle parameters details collected from CNHI, it will also include the additional details that are captured exclusively by the DMS in the Workorder like the details of the repair, technician, payment, customer etc. 
DMS will transfer the details of all the Workorder to DEP, as and when it is ready to be interfaced in a REST format by invoking DEP’s API. 
Pictorial representation of the data flows below.
